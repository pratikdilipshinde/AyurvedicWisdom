                            1. Cultivation of Self Awareness

                            The simplest definition of meditation is the cultivation of self-awareness. Without self-awareness we cannot see what we are doing wrong at the levels of our own thoughts and feelings. In fact, we cannot even see that it is I and not someone else who creates my thoughts and feelings!
                        </h4>
                        <h4 className='text-indent-8 text-justify'>
                            When you fall under the illusion that others are responsible for what you are feeling you condemn yourself to a stressful life, as you become dependent on external sources of stimulation in order to feel OK, and then perform our very own award winning performance of The Victim!
                        </h4>
                        <h4 className='text-indent-8 text-justify'>
                            Meditation raises your self-awareness and therefore self-responsibility.
                        </h4>

                            2. Self Control
                        </h4>
                        <h4 className='text-indent-8 text-justify'>
                            In the external world we tend to define control as getting a grip on things and handling people and issues firmly. In the internal world of our thoughts and feelings, control does not come with a tight grip, or a struggle, or trying to make certain thoughts and feelings go away. Control on the inside comes from doing the opposite i.e. letting go, and being more like a detached observer of our thoughts and feelings. This is the first step in the practice of meditation, which will eventually give you the ability to be the master of our own thoughts and feelings.

                        <h4 className='text-indent-8 text-justify'>
                            In a world almost totally focused on action it is easy to forget that we are a human being first, and human doing second. It is easy to forget that everything we do flows from our state of being. Few of us learn how to create our state of being, yet we all know that if we start the day in a dull and grumpy mood it doesnÂ’t matter how beautiful the day may be, it is still a dull and grumpy day! Once you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, once you see why they emerge (self awareness) and once you restore the power of choice and control, you can work at a deeper level and consciously create your state. Just as the miner works deep underground at the coalface, so meditation gives you the ability to work at the deepest levels of your consciousness, at the coalface of the soul. It is there that you find your original states of peace, love and a natural joyfulness that are not dependent on anything external.

                        <h4 className='text-indent-8 text-justify'>
                            Life is a relationship, and relationship is communication. Both our success and satisfaction in life will depend to a large degree on how well we communicate with others. Our ways of communication are largely learned from external influences like parents and society, which means many of us have difficulty in connecting and communicating from our own heart, our true heart. The practice of meditation, which is essentially a journey to the heart, helps you to see and understand the internal blocks, barriers and burdens that distort our communication with others. Meditation allows us to dissolve our blocks and heal your heart in your own time, at your own pace in your own way.

                        <h4 className='text-center font-bold text-lg'>
                            Meditation is a journey not a destination. As you practice with patience and perseverance, the process of learning meditation takes you towards perfection. As it does the journey also becomes the destination.
